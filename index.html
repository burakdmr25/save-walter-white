            My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I
            <br>
            found out he was going to die. That it was going to happen
            <br>
            soon. That it was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff.
            <br>
            Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind
            <br>
            of took him for granted or something. I mean, our parents are
            <br>
            just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you
            <br>
            to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or
            <br>
            try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one
            <br>
            day. And make you get up early on the weekend to have
            <br>
            "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me
            <br>
            crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different since
            <br>
            Dad got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the
            <br>
            near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.

        <p>
            Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that
            <br>
            question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-
            <br>
            sible. One day he won't be here to ask. Now I feel lucky when I hear
            <br>
            his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-
            <br>
            ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.

My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.
<br>
I mean, super brainiac annoying.  He knows the most random stuff.  Like
<br>
how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.
<br>
And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it
<br>
takes up about 9% more space.  Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt
<br>
into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level
<br>
will go down.  He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He
<br>
doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.
<br>
I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is.  He likes to cook
<br>
because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-
<br>
cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he
<br>
goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.
<br>
He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.
<br>
<br>
The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always had to
<br>
hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.
<br>
(Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser
<br>
shoes he always wears).  Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.
<br>
Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with teachers.
<br>
The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does,
<br>
and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That's
<br>
how he is at home and at school.  I only just figured out what a good qual-
<br>
ity that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what
<br>
made me brave, too when I was younger.  Whether I wanted to be or not.
<br>
Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because of
<br>
my dad being a teacher there I was different.  I realize two things now.
<br>
First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal.
<br>
And two, he's the right dad for me.  I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-
<br>
cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be with a
<br>
lot of other dads I've met.  They'd be disappointed because they're into
<br>
sports or whatever.  I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability but you sure
<br>
wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It
<br>
makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't care
<br>
about what the kids at school say anymore.  The bottom line is he's a good
<br>
teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he
<br>
cares.  After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the
<br>
best.  I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do
<br>
for a long time.  For him, for his students, and for me and my family
<br>
<br>
It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer.  Not
<br>
that there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as that,
<br>
but it was sure a bad time for us.  My mom was pregnant with what she calls
<br>
a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she's a newborn baby she's
<br>
actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help pay
<br>
all the regular bills. And that was before he got his diagnosis.  We don't
<br>
have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical bills.  And
<br>
my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take char-
<br>
ity.  That's why I'm doing this.  Not because I want to make him mad or
<br>
upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.
<br>
<br>
One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more than a
<br>
regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones) don't
<br>
take insurance.  I think that's wrong.  I mean, one of the big reasons why
<br>
my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he
<br>
didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about my
<br>
dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself.  But we want himself
<br>
around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as
<br>
possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life.  And we
<br>
can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have with
<br>
him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my dad.  I want her to
<br>
know him for herself.
